00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:22,000
We talked about evolution. Today we can actually see it.  
Today's research in the development of life, is a

2
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,240
meeting of revolutionary new technologies and old issues, 
because when genetic scientists looked closely

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
at our genes and DNA

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we are starting to see it in the light of evolution

5
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:46,000
the classic issues that are starting to get answered with 
the help of genetic engineering is who is related to whom.

6
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:58,060
We wish to label everything. We can see that deep down,
 a whale is a swimming camel.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,970
It's not obvious when you see it, but we have been forced 
to move about a lot of branches on the tree of life.

8
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,980
''Furgus''

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,060
Hello?
Hey, it's me.

10
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,910
How are you doing?
 Ok.

11
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,000
How was it?

12
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,064
Well, how did it go?

13
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,640
I'm gonna die.
Come on...

14
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,640
He won't see me anymore.
 What?

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,035
Well, it's...
 First, he said that he didn't have enough time.

16
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:01,003
Then he said that there wasn't enough time.

17
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,640
Then, he said that he's in love with another.

18
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,640
He has been seeing her all this time.

19
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,040
That sounds totally crazy!

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,070
What a fucking asshole.

21
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,800
Well, now they have cut down my hours,
 which is not fun at all

22
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,040
I think he has given me a fucking venerial disease.
 Come on...

23
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,790
I will die.
 You will not die.

24
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,480
Yes!
No!

25
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,070
Yes, it itches like hell and I will die!
 No!

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,752
No, but you've probably got fungus.

27
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,130
I've had it and it's disgusting! It itches.

28
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,040
You can just get some stuff from the pharmacy. 
I think I have some left. And then...

29
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,870
Wait.

30
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,790
Has she gone mad?
Who?

31
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,810
The old lady in number nine!
What's she doing?

32
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,610
She's like a hundred years old and now she's standing 
completely fucking naked, just screaming!

33
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,520
Nude? Are you kidding?
 No, I'm not.

34
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,670
That's sick!

35
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,880
What's she doing now?

36
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,920
Tell me!

37
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,290
What's she doing?

38
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,970
This is so weird.

39
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,150
Well, now they've cut down my hours 
and that doesn't feel good at all.

40
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,130
I'm gonna die! He's given me shit.

41
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:59,000
Cut it out. You've got fungus. You just have to buy...

42
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,190
What's that?
Wait.

43
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,080
Hello?
 It's me. Can you let me in? I'm just gonna grab my stuff,

44
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,770
the jacket and the pan. I' ll be fast.

45
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,020
Hello?

46
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,100
Katrin?

47
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,450
Hello, hello, hello, hello?

48
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,210
Hello? Hey, what's going on?
He's here.

49
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,060
For fuck's sake.
 He's outside.

50
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,150
Don't let him in!
 Tell him that you're not at home.

51
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,290
He wants his stuff back. There's an itch between my legs
 and he wants his stuff back.

52
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,310
Toss it out from the balcony or something.
 Let me in, Katrin! I know you're there, you just answered!

53
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,240
Hey, doesn't he owe you money?
A thousand kronor.

54
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,670
Did you get it back?

55
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,640
Did you get it back?

56
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,440
I'm sorry. Hey, I'm really sorry.

57
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:16,720
Last week he told me he loved me. I love him, you know.
No, I don't get it at all.

58
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,170
My jacket and pan.
Is it itching?

59
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,210
Like hell.
Yeah, well...

60
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,200
Katrin? What the hell is she doing?

61
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,570
Katrin?

62
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,360
Hello?

63
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,270
Hello?

64
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,280
Hello, hello, hello, hello?

65
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,790
Answer me!

66
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,990
Katrin?

67
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,860
I'm hanging up now.

68
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,000
Katrin, I'm hanging up now.

69
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,410
Hello?

70
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,750
I'm hanging up now.

71
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,350
Hello?
Hello!

72
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,850
Where the hell did you go?

73
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,250
I won't get my money back.

74
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,110
Well, just tell him that you want it back.
I have to go.

75
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:50,420
Come on now. It's only fungus. You're not going to die. 
Just buy one of those ointments.

76
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,910
Perhaps.

77
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:59,460
Anyway. I have another meeting with my boss. 
You know, I've been working there for five years...

78
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:06,060
the whales. Both whales and dolphins belong to a 
bransch that goes out from the tree of life.

79
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:13,150
So, we follow it back so that we can see where it meets 
other animals. Which animals are similar to whales?

80
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:24,480
Then we enter into what we call the ungulates.
This includes, for example,cows, pigs and camels.

81
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,780
Among all the other animals, whales are the closest...
