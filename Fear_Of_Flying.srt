00:00:32,106 --> 00:00:32,935
Good morning.

3
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:05,913
Hey!

4
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:09,029
Woops, sorry! I didn't see you down there.

5
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:15,039
Oh. Heh!, eh... no problem. I should really
watch where I'm going.

6
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:19,047
What are you doing down there anyway? Everyone's heading
South in a few hours.

7
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:28,035
Oh, I... I...  eh, I dropped something. Yeah, you guys go on
ahead, eh I'll follow you on.

8
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,592
Eh... who's this guy?

9
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:32,650
I never got your name?

10
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,842
It's Dougal.

11
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:38,982
Hi Dougal, my name's Lucy. This is Dick.

12
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:41,127
Hi Dick.

13
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,901
Come on Lucy, let's get the flock outta here.

14
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:48,973
Nice to meet you Dougal, I guess I'll see you down there!

15
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,299
Good Morning.

16
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:11,002
Can I have ten packs of beetle husks, five tins of hazel nut
butter, eight packs of dried elderberries,

17
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,007
one pot of honey,a half case of nettle tea, two doz... ten
packs of fresh poppyseed,

18
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:19,032
two tins of rose-hip syrup and a
box of fennel mash.

19
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:22,019
Oh, and how much for that plant?

20
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,959
Now, where to put you?

21
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:48,082
Perfect.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,011
We'll be fine.

23
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,096
Plenty more rain on the way, with showers due to continue
right through to the end of...

24
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:36,360
I don't care about the accident I s...

25
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,208
And if you do continue to eat these worms combined of course
with regular...

26
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:44,023
We are down here in the Sunny South and just check out some
of these chicks!

27
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:47,915
Lucy?

28
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:02,483
There's nothing left.

29
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:14,001
I've gotta get out of here. But how? I can't fly. Of Course
you can fly- you're a bird. 

30
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:18,000
If I stay I'll freeze to death.Or starve!
 I shouldn't even be here. I should be down south with the others. 

31
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:20,037
I could be on the beach with Lucy. You
don't want to end up like him!

32
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:25,007
I've gotta do it.

33
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:30,977
This is it.

34
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:15,999
Ha! I did it, I'm flying, I'm really flying!

35
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:31,017
Welcome to the sunny south!

36
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:39,016
Hey, Dougal, great to see you!

37
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:43,003
Lucy, this place, it's amazing!

38
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:46,226
Yeah, Dick and I were wondering if you were gonna make it.

39
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:48,200
Oh yeah, Dick.

40
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,992
Hey Dick, look who it is.

41
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:55,107
Hey Dougal!

42
00:07:57,836 --> 00:08:01,018
Oh. Hey Dick. So you guys aren't...

43
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:02,533
Noooo!

44
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:03,743
Ahhhh.

45
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,921
Dougal, now that you're here, I wanted to ask you something.

46
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:10,936
Yeah Lucy?

47
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:13,994
Do you...  wanna go for a swim?

48
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,615
Swim? Hu! Eh, OK!
