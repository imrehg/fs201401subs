1
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:32,410
  Hey!

2
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:34,448
Come on!

3
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:36,068
Stop!

4
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:40,765
That's my camera! That's my camera!

5
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:46,611
Stop them! 

6
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:30,426
You bastards!  

7
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:32,746
Sorry.

8
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:37,677
Thank you.

9
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,050
You, are the worst beach boy I know.

10
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:44,014
I am simply the best at being the worst.

11
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:03,029
 I am bored.

12
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:06,867
You are often bored, Mbwana.

13
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:15,062
The same beachy, the same sun, the same life.
 We need to build something in this town, no? 

14
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:24,035
What we need is tourist dollars, and we won't get tourist dollars 
thieving from the few Muzungu we have, eh?

15
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:26,377
The tourists we have are not good enough.
 

16
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:29,894
We need to change things, eh? We need to build something wild here.

17
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:32,176
Your brain is wild, Mbwana.

18
00:02:33,174 --> 00:02:36,011
We need to build the Buckingham Palace.

19
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:38,672
Buckingham Palace?

20
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:44,016
Why not, eh? Get the Queen to move in and
 then we can build the Eiffel Tower.

21
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:50,076
I prefer the Rag Mahal. You are too wild Mbwana.

22
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,009
I will kick you, I will kick you!

23
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:18,973
So you are taking pictures? 

24
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:20,939
You look like one of those lesbians.

25
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,130
Just give me the pictures. 
Delete it, delete the picture.

26
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:26,702
Okay, take it properly then.

27
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,136
Look at this.

28
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,550
That was a good one.

29
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:33,080
You look like an Italian lesbian

30
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,240
Let me see that one.

31
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:36,094
A Spanish lesbian, with a Drogba face.

32
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:38,144
You are jealous. Take another one.

33
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,052
Do you think I have a best side or are they both equally better? 

34
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:45,449
I think they are both equally ugly, so it's okay!

35
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,980
Vogue, Vogue.

36
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:52,990
You look like a buffoon.

37
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,067
A baboon? I know many fine baboons.

38
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:18,008
Did you see that? Did you see that? 

39
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,563
Juma, Juma did you take the photo?

40
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:27,984
I did. I got the picture, look at it.

41
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:39,847
Where are you going?

42
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,463
To make some tourist dollar!

43
00:05:16,757 --> 00:05:18,936
Yes, this is quite something. 

44
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:31,985
Zanzibar is fast becoming the worldâ€™s capital 
in the realm of giant fish.

45
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:36,980
Thousands of tourists are making the trip and 
heading to the most spectacular.

46
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,994
Hi everybody, raise your glasses to me, the Fish Man!

47
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:13,814
More, more, more!

48
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:34,602
Go, go, I don't need you anyway, 
I'll find my way, I'll find my way home  

49
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,467
No room for you on the bus, old man.

50
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:36,813
Quite something. 

51
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:58,139
Get back!
