1
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:08,941
I have an iron will. 

2
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:11,267
to achieve the goals of a
 peaceful revolution

3
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:13,934
to achieve the goals of a
 peaceful revolution

4
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:16,981
to achieve the goals of a
 civil nation

5
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:21,999
My house is small.

6
00:00:22,962 --> 00:00:24,962
It can be hard to breathe.

7
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:31,528
So when I found that key,


8
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:33,498
I was curious.

9
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:41,073
Because I knew the key belonged to the big man

10
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:46,017
 I knew it was for his big house.

11
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,002
I heard he was gone.

12
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,823
 And it was true. He was gone.

13
00:00:53,264 --> 00:00:56,464
The house was empty.
So I took a chance.

14
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:08,104
You would've done the same.

15
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:17,992
Let me tell you.
It's a different world inside.

16
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:21,878
He's got everything he needs.

17
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:24,361
And more.

18
00:01:57,018 --> 00:01:59,018
So why shouldn't he share?

19
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,918
Can't he give me a little?

20
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:13,897
Aren't I a good kid?
I deserve it.

21
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:23,587
With all that space, I could breathe. 

22
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:35,931
I felt like I could move.

23
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,053
I felt like I could fly.

24
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:16,435
Who's there?

25
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:18,618
There he is!

26
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:20,596
Get out!

27
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,956
But that's not my house. 

28
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:38,943
And it never will be.

29
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:42,061
So where do I go?

30
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:47,008
Where can I breathe?

31
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:05,838
I guess...

32
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:08,924
there are other rooms.
