1
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:17,941
Peter!

2
00:00:17,982 --> 00:00:18,974
Jesus Christ.

3
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:19,930
Can you get in please?

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,992
Did you put my jacket in?

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,755
Yes. 

6
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:22,705
 And my skirt?

7
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:26,032
Yes. It's in the back.
Now get in, it's going to be 4½  hours

8
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:27,142
All right.

9
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:34,225
I don't feel happy about leaving the boys.

10
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:36,409
They're with your sister Alison, they will be fine.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,996
I'd told them we'd back in time for Sunday lunch 
but I don't think they believe me.

12
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:47,018
They don't believe you Alison because they are dogs. 
They can't understand you.

13
00:00:47,228 --> 00:00:48,009
Yes they can.

14
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:48,986
No they can't.

15
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:51,974
Peter I am with them all day.
They understand me perfectly.

16
00:00:54,992 --> 00:00:58,591
Well if they understand you so well, 
you can ask them to shit directly 

17
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:00,115
into the plastic bag when they take them for a walk.

18
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:01,916
or better still into the bin.

19
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,953
Maybe they could do some pots once in a while
 or mow the lawn.

20
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:10,202
Peter what is wrong with you today?
Is it your toenail thing?

21
00:01:10,255 --> 00:01:12,143
No, it's not the townail thing.

22
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:18,204
I don't see why we have to rush down there today
they're not getting married until tomorrow.

23
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:21,018
I told you 3 months ago this was the plan.

24
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:23,578
We're going up on Friday night 
because we're meeting them in the pub.

25
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:25,856
I'm going to miss my Saturday morning lengths.

26
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:29,043
Everyone is meeting in the pub this evening (who is everyone?),
pre-wedding drinks. 

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,994
We're meeting The Gang,
you know I used to

28
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:35,938
Tooty's Gang?

29
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:39,995
It wasn't her gang, it was just people 
I was used to hang out with at university.

30
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:41,596
You don't hang out with them much anymore.

31
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,872
Of course I do, we had Christmas drinks
 with Davey in that pub.

32
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,452
Who?

33
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:44,974
Davey

34
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:46,229
The fat man in the rugby shirt?

35
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:46,957
Yes.

36
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,043
The one who fell over the pregnant woman.

37
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,303
He didn't fall.

38
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,072
He's ghastly.

39
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:51,251
He was off balance.

40
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,024
He was drinking whisky.

41
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:53,975
Yes, well that's not a crime, is it?

42
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:55,987
Well, we should check into the B&b first.

43
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:56,455
What?

44
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,043
We have to check into the B&b first.

45
00:01:58,072 --> 00:01:59,024
Why are you saying like that?

46
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,931
I'm not saying like that.

47
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:00,461
You are.

48
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:01,018
I'm not.

49
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:02,059
Weird.
"B&b".

50
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:03,048
Yes, that's what I said.

51
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:03,872
Bed & Breakfast.

52
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:04,191
B&b.

53
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:06,051
Not a "B&b, a "B&B".

54
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:08,915
B&b, it's like A&e.

55
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:09,954
What's that got to do with?

56
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:10,989
Well it's like P&o.

57
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:11,811
What?

58
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:12,973
Or D&g.

59
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:14,348
What's that?

60
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,004
Oh P I'm literally getting married tomorrow.

61
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:17,942
I know.

62
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:18,951
Cigarello?

63
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:24,344
It's been an age, but go on.

64
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:29,752
Tell. Me. Everything.

65
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:31,849
Well, there's not much to tell…

66
00:02:35,974 --> 00:02:36,998
How's Alice?

67
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:43,989
Very well actually, she's good. 
It's Alison.

68
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:50,986
Toots I lost my job.

69
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:53,878
Poor P.

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,806
A couple of months ago. Alison doesn't know.

71
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:03,992
It's quite funny I've just been hanging 
around in Hyde Park in the day.

72
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,815
You'll find another

73
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:09,995
Yeah, well, I've got this meeting 
with Alan Teasdale, next week.

74
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:19,744
I'm really hoping that comes through because, if it doesn't
 I'm going to be in a bit of a pickle, you know, mortgage people

75
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:23,972
I can't believe I am actually getting married tomorrow!

76
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:24,903
Yeah, I know.

77
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:28,917
Do you remember at university 
we used to do this all the time?

78
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:31,993
Yeah, I know, we went to that pub, The Plough,
 do you remember?

79
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:36,031
You used to smoke indoors then,
 this feels really naughty.

80
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:37,559
It is naughty. 

81
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:39,418
It's really naughty.

82
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:45,492
Do you remember when we were really, really naughty?

83
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:55,710
You know, I can't believe I only got to fuck you once.

84
00:03:58,774 --> 00:03:59,068
Peter!

85
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:01,995
Hi Alice, you look nice.

86
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,638
Are you smoking?

87
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,231
No.

88
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:08,198
Yes.

89
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,095
Why are you standing like that?

90
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:14,989
I need the loo. So…

91
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:21,645
Peter, when are we going to check-in at the B&b?

92
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:35,987
That's Davey.
Look, I need to use the credit card.

93
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:38,934
You've got your one haven't you?

94
00:04:39,732 --> 00:04:40,990
Yeah but it's not working.

95
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:41,608
Why not?

96
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:47,065
Well, I don't know. I can't phone them and ask.

97
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,195
Yes you can it's 24 hour, or India,
 that's awake now…

98
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,256
I bought a round so I need to pay for it.

99
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:57,978
How much is it? I've got some money.

100
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:03,851
It's... £486.

101
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:04,361
What!?

102
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,902
Look, I offered to buy the meal as well, because...

103
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:07,979
Why?

104
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:11,818
Well, because it's the gang isn't it?
 It's the university gang and I

105
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:12,096
Peter!

106
00:05:12,223 --> 00:05:13,398
It's what you do.

107
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:13,994
It's a lot of money.

108
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:16,542
Just please give me the card.

109
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,852
It's supposed to be for emergencies only.

110
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:24,181
Stupid.

111
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:36,558
What's the PIN number?

112
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:38,003
It's my birthday.

113
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:44,074
Peter, it's four days after our wedding anniversary.

114
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,506
Alison. I think it's time to switch the light out.
 

115
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:10,111
I'm reading my book.

116
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,485
You've been reading that book for about 7 months.

117
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:19,725
It's quite a complicated story

118
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:22,825
You're on page 23 or something.

119
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:23,393
24

120
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:38,142
Do you remember Toulouse?

121
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:48,027
Do you remember what we did?

122
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:05,819
It is lights out.

123
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:14,729
Sorry, sorry.

124
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:22,501
Shall I take these off Mademoiselle?

125
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:32,900
That's nice.

126
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,007
What have we here?

127
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:12,003
Wait! Wait! Wait!

128
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:12,606
I can't! I can't!

129
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:16,858
Is this because of Tooty?

130
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,102
Sorry, I'm sorry

131
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:32,663
That's OK.

132
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:38,337
You're on my arm.

133
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:39,838
Sorry.

134
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:42,980
Goodnight.

135
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:40,999
You OK?

136
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:42,666
Sorry. Sorry.

137
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,327
Don't be sorry.

138
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:47,245
 What's wrong?

139
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:55,105
It's nothing, it's stupid. Stupid Peter, he's stupid

140
00:10:58,053 --> 00:10:58,877
Right.

141
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:04,122
He's been dirty dancing with Tooty all evening.
 Would he dance with me? No.

142
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:06,006
Well, he's a fool, isn't he?

143
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:13,013
I asked him if he'd put my skirt in the car and he said he had.
 But he hadn't.

144
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,700
I think it looks fine with the jeans.

145
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:22,369
Thank you.

146
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:27,967
I've got an idea. I'm Aiden by the way.

147
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:28,959
Alison.

148
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,198
That's a lovely name.

149
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:31,687
Is it?

150
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:40,058
Listen Alison, what I like to do when I'm a little bit upset, 
is just go to my car and relax.

151
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:42,881
I just like to relax.

152
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:44,305
Me too.

153
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:45,627
Really?

154
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:51,962
Do want to come with me and relax?

155
00:11:54,242 --> 00:11:55,002
In my car?

156
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:57,128
Yes.

157
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,003
Cool. Follow me.

158
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:13,771
Hey Toots.

159
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:14,257
Hi P.

160
00:12:14,682 --> 00:12:15,354
No, no, no.

161
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:19,036
I just thought you'd want a drink.

162
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:28,578
Oh, shit, sorry.

163
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:29,986
Cheers!

164
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:31,105
Cheers.

165
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,422
Listen, no, no, no Toots, listen. 

166
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:44,283
I've got a really serious thing that I've gotta say,
 cos I've been thinking about this  

167
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:45,007
sort of for a long time, actually a lot today.

168
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,973
And I just wanted to say that I love you.

169
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:51,994
Aaahh I love you to P.

170
00:12:53,048 --> 00:12:57,995
No listen to me. 
I love you and I've loved you ever since I first met you.

171
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:03,980
You know what, we could go now couldn't we?

172
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:06,988
Pete what are you doing?

173
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:08,980
No c'mon we could do that!

174
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:11,983
Look I don't have much but we could go.

175
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:18,959
I really don't have much because unless Alan Teasdale 
comes good next week I am fucked.

176
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:22,024
I am totally fucked.

177
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:24,566
But Pete, you're really drunk, seriously.

178
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:28,126
I'm drunk on love OK.

179
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:31,002
I'm drunk on love for you

180
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:34,860
I love Doug, I've just married Doug.

181
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:38,793
Doug!? C'mon!

182
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:44,955
So yesterday in the pub and you were on me and I was on you…

183
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:49,883
Listen you know that we could have sex right now.

184
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:55,980
And I know that's what you want because I want it too, 
so let's just go and do that now.

185
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:58,990
My cousin has a pace in Dorset, or Devon, but I could phone him.

186
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,056
Peter! It's Doug. It's Doug

187
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,946
Oooo It's Doug! I'm in the army! I'm Doug! I'm Brilliant!

188
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:14,034
The things is the Moroccans, they know how to deal with stress.

189
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,966
I'm the same as you, I get stressed out at weddings.

190
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:28,997
Weddings are always the same. People having arguments about this and that.

191
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:36,948
You've just to get Moroccan about it and that suits me 
because I like the Moroccan stuff.

192
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:42,144
Jesus Christ!

193
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:43,739
Teach them.

194
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:45,710
I'm gay.

195
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:49,395
I’m gay.

196
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:56,358
I have been thinking about it for a while 

197
00:14:56,922 --> 00:15:02,962
and I've realised I'm definitely gay.

198
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:17,962
It’s just that you said about relaxing in the car.

199
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,012
I meant smoking a spliff. 

200
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:23,027
I didn't mean...

201
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:30,051
getting fresh.

202
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:36,937
Is it my breasts have they turned you gay?

203
00:15:37,877 --> 00:15:38,406
No! 

204
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,112
They're very nice.

205
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:45,739
Thank you.

206
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:57,534
If I had to rate them out of 10.

207
00:16:00,015 --> 00:16:03,050
I'd say.
6

208
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:03,491
6?

209
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:07,008
7
Definitely, definitely 7.

210
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:12,041
That's quite good isn't it?

211
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:12,390
Yup.

212
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:22,829
My hairdresser is gay I think.

213
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,857
He's called Craig.

214
00:17:04,984 --> 00:17:06,721
I lost my job Alison.

215
00:17:06,987 --> 00:17:09,998
I know.
Tooty told me last night.

216
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:15,045
After she told me you'd had sex together back 
when you were in your Gang.

217
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:18,945
But you should know.

218
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:24,847
Last night a man told me my breasts were a 7
which is actually quite high.

219
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:33,062
I rang the dogs
told them we'd be back by lunchtime.

220
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:38,987
Did they ask us to pick anything up?

221
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:40,976
Don't be stupid Peter. They're dogs.

222
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,060
If you just

223
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:47,718
Not a word.
