1
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:14,566
I can lift this bit.

2
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,010
I can.

3
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:19,663
You need somebody to get the other end.

4
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:22,588
No, you don't.

5
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,010
There's one tiny bit.

6
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:29,499
Right, we need it in that pile.

7
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:31,084
One more.

8
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:34,047
Right, let me carry it.

9
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:35,985
Put it there.

10
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:38,405
Put it over there.

11
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,972
Tiny bit more.

12
00:02:40,472 --> 00:02:42,075
Down there, what I left.

13
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,271
Down there it is.

14
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,401
Right,

15
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:52,768
do it.

16
00:02:57,982 --> 00:02:59,994
This isn't very heavy.

17
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:07,989
I cannot lift all of those at the same time.

18
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,906
All of those I cannot lift.

19
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,340
I'm driving the animal boat.

20
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:53,143
I keep, I keep their food

21
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:58,107
in here, in this little hole

22
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:05,946
And I sprinkle it out all over the floors of the boat.

23
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:11,843
The giraffes like leaves.

24
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:15,996
The lions, I think the lions like

25
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,143
The lions like

26
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:28,988
prowling around, 
so I give them prowling around lessons.

27
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:10,989
What do you have to do?

28
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:13,489
Don't!
Don't!

29
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:15,786
You lifted it!

30
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:18,061
No, I did.

31
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:19,305
Why?

32
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:22,007
What do you have to do,
what are you doing?

33
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,788
What are you doing?

34
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:29,073
I'm making an aeroplane.

35
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,018
Lunchtime?

36
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,528
It's lunchtime!

37
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:06,639
What is that?

38
00:07:06,945 --> 00:07:08,067
An aeroplane.

39
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:10,513
Can I go in the aeroplane?

40
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:11,994
Yes,
Can I?

41
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,059
And we need a lift to America!

42
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,876
America?

43
00:07:18,024 --> 00:07:20,024
Ok.

44
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:23,011
Can I just get a gearstick?

45
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:29,146
And I would like to be taken to Ben 10 World.

46
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:34,704
My place first!

47
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,669
And then my place.

48
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,037
Then your place, then your place.

49
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:45,036
I want to go to Fire Land.

50
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:50,006
Everybody sitting quietly?

51
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,517
Good

52
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:05,009
There's Ben 10 World.

53
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,938
At Batman World!

54
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:19,279
That's you at Batman World

55
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:22,769
Where do you want to go my best pal?

56
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,304
I want to go to Flyer World.

57
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:33,069
This is Fire World.

58
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:37,069
Where do you want to go?

59
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:41,984
Fire World?

60
00:08:42,484 --> 00:08:43,838
So do you, don't you?

61
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,929
Actually, I don't want to

62
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:49,897
I want to go to Smoke Bloke Land.

63
00:08:58,032 --> 00:09:03,015
Girls are not allowed to go to Smoke Bloke Land.

64
00:09:03,924 --> 00:09:07,191
cause that's too difficult for them.

65
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,056
Can I go back?
Can I go back?

66
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,546
I really wanted to go to America.

67
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:22,191
America?
I do too.

68
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:26,026
Right, that's you at America!

69
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,201
No, we haven't even drived!
Yes, we have.

70
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:33,150
No we haven't.
Yes I have.

71
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No we haven't.

72
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,294
That's you and you at America.

73
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:49,907
Then to Smoke Bloke Land!

74
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:59,240
That's you at Smoke Bloke Land.

75
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,975
Where do you want to go?
Fire World?

76
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:06,020
Where do you want to go?

77
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:12,045
Into the middle of nowhere.
Into the middle of nowhere!

78
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:15,875
Right, you have to get on there
and you have to get on there.

79
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:20,562
That's you at nowhere.

80
00:10:21,062 --> 00:10:22,907
Go get off.

81
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:27,555
Where do you want to go?

82
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:30,055
Can I be an aeroplane?

83
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:36,082
This is just an aeroplane that I built
and it's for me.

84
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:41,016
Well, can I be a

85
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:44,450
an aeroplane that can move?

86
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:50,010
This can't move.
This can't move.

87
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:57,034
If I be an aeroplane, can I move?

88
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:01,231
This is not a moving aeroplane.

89
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:06,004
I'll be a moving aeroplane.
What?

90
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:11,077
I move, no play aeroplane.

91
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:16,948
You can pretend to have an aeroplane.

92
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:16,021
Hello Mr. Ladybird!

93
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:19,281
A ladybird?
Yeah.

94
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:21,976
They have poisonous wee.

95
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:23,999
Who says that?

96
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:26,974
Woody and Logan.

97
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:33,120
I think,
do you think they have got poisonous poo?

98
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,319
No, I don't think they are telling the truth.

99
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:40,903
No, they aren't.

100
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm going to tell them not to do it.
